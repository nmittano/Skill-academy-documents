In the Connect dialog box, enter appsread for the User Name, appsread for the Password, and the name of your database for the Database field.

--->Fetch the appropriate table from the database.

PAPER LAYOUT:

WINSCP:

-->go to winscp, copy the file from the local machine to server and save the report.


ORACLE APPLICATION:

-->Create Executable: Link it to Report file(.rdf) created
Navigation: Login into Oracle Applications –> Go to Application Developer Responsibility –> Concurrent –> Executable.
	
	Executable	   :XX12_AR
	Short name	   :XX12_AR
	Application	   :Application Developer
	Execution method   :oracle reports
	Execution file name:XX12_AR_report

-->After Developing a report to register as a concurrent program.
Navigation: Application Developer –> Concurrent –> Program

	valueset	   :AR_ou_valueset
	Default type	   :constant
	token	           :AR_ou_name
